Web Scraper Pro

Web Scraper Pro is a powerful and advanced web scraping tool that allows you to extract data from websites efficiently and easily. With a modern graphical user interface (GUI) powered by Tkinter and CustomTkinter, you can scrape various elements like tags, attributes, and content from web pages.

Features

Scraping: Extract data from URLs by specifying tags and optional attributes (e.g., a, div, p, span, img, etc.).

Exporting: Export scraped data to CSV, PDF (Premium), or ZIP files.

Scraping History: Keep track of your scraping history with timestamps and results.

Raw HTML View: View raw HTML files to see the structure and content of a webpage.

Progress Bar: Visual progress bar to track scraping progress.

SQLite Database: All scraping history is saved in a local SQLite database for future reference.


How It Works

1. Enter URL(s): Input the URLs from which you want to scrape data.


2. Select a Tag: Choose the HTML tag (e.g., a, div, img) you want to scrape.


3. Optionally Enter an Attribute: Provide an optional attribute (e.g., href, src, etc.) to target specific parts of the tag.


4. Start Scraping: Click the "Start Scraping" button to begin the scraping process.


5. Export Results: After scraping, you can export the results in different formats, including CSV, PDF (Premium), or ZIP.
